*"What's the point?"*,  you ask...

## A Letter of Intent

I spent a decade trying to make robots come to life like I've seen in the movies. Some of my robots were even *in* those movies, but it never quite satisfied. They were too dumb. Too slow. To costly for widespread use.

Working in computer simulation changed all that. Digital characters are cheap to build, duplicate, and run. Importantly, I found that through Virtual Reality and related technologies simulated objects are also **present** - soon to be indistinguishable from things in physical reality.

Simultaneously, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are improving our natural interactions with the world's digital layer. Speaking and gesturing is becoming productive and emotionally engaging.

Virtual Assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa exemplify the trend, especially when paired with knowledge systems like Wolfram Alpha.

I want to develop Avatars, or embodied agents, with a **lower mind** to navigate their environment -- physical and social -- and a **higher mind** powered by our modern AI / IoT.

I don't want to deal with researching and tailoring interfaces for every Avatar. I'd like a consistent interface to build against no matter the functionality of the higher mind. I figure there are other Avatar makers with similar attitudes. So we'll build a nice bit of middleware for our Avatar interface and then keep it maintained and improved apace with the higher mind.

I hope to maintain a codebase straightforward enough that the effort to implant a particular higher mind application would be easier than building the capability for the platform directly into ones Avatar, thereby opening up the platform to every other Avatar using the middleware.

Virtual Assistants are particularly well-suited as higher minds for Avatars. The current market leaders are Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri. I have some ethical concerns with focusing my effort in a way that primarily benefits corporations that have historically shown little concern for privacy, so I will look to involve Avatars first with Mycroft.

[Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/) is a private, open-source voice assistant.  Users can build the client software on a variety of platforms and work is underway to distribute the server software. The goal of Mycroft is for the users (individuals and companies) to fully own their voice assistants.

I'm not certain if this middleware approach is right or if I'm the right person to be working on it, but I think the challenges are true and worthwhile to pursue.
