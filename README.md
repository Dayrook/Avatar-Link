# Avatar Link

Avatar Link serves as middleware, loosely coupling application software and its embodied agent, or avatar.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are improving our natural interactions with the world's digital layer. Virtual Assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa exemplify the trend, especially when paired with knowledge systems like Wolfram Alpha.

We are first implementing the interface to the [Mycroft](https://mycroft.ai/)  virtual assistant.

## Goal

Avatar developers can focus on making compelling digital characters with **lower minds** to navigate their environment -- physical and social -- and then simply plug in a **higher mind** powered by our modern AI / IoT.

Rather than researching and tailoring interfaces for every Avatar, the Avatar Link will provide a a consistent interface to build against no matter the functionality of the higher mind.
